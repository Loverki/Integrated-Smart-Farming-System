2. Farm Management - Add, view, edit, delete farms with location tracking
3. Crop Management - Track sowing, harvest dates, expected vs. actual yield
4. Sales Tracking - Record crop sales, track payments, calculate revenue
5. Fertilizer Management - Record fertilizer applications and costs
6. Labor Management - Track workers, hours worked, calculate labor costs
7. Equipment Management - Manage farming equipment inventory
8. Weather Dashboard - Real-time weather and 5-day forecast for each farm location
9. Notifications - Receive alerts from admin about weather, farming tips
10. Analytics - Financial analytics, revenue trends, crop performance

For Admins:
1. System Dashboard - Overview of all farmers, farms, crops, total revenue
2. Farmer Management - View, activate/deactivate farmer accounts
3. System Analytics - System-wide performance metrics and trends
4. Notification Management - Send targeted or broadcast messages to farmers
5. Database Tools - Execute SQL queries, manage database
6. User Management - Create and manage admin accounts (role-based)
7. Sequence Management - Reset database sequences

DATABASE SCHEMA:
10 main tables: FARMER, ADMIN, FARM, CROP, SALES, FERTILIZER, LABOUR, LABOURWORK, EQUIPMENT, WEATHER_DATA
Database views for analytics: FARM_PERFORMANCE, CROP_SUMMARY, SALES_OVERVIEW, FERTILIZER_USAGE, LABOUR_COST_SUMMARY
Stored procedures for sequence management

AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY:
- JWT token-based authentication (24h for farmers, 8h for admins)
- bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (Farmer, Admin, Super Admin)
- Automatic logout on account deletion/deactivation
- Database verification on every request
- Protected routes with middleware

API ENDPOINTS:
- 40+ RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, verify)
- Farmer CRUD operations (farms, crops, sales, fertilizers, labor, equipment)
- Weather endpoints (current weather, forecast, alerts)
- Admin endpoints (farmer management, analytics, notifications, database queries)
- Notification endpoints (in-app messaging system)

USER INTERFACE:
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- 30+ pages for various functionalities
- Real-time data updates
- Indian number formatting (10,00,000)
- Weather visualization with 5-day forecasts
- Analytics dashboards with charts and metrics

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Complete farm-to-sale lifecycle tracking
2. Real-time weather integration for Indian cities with geocoding
3. In-app notification system (no external SMS required)
4. Automatic database sequence synchronization
5. Robust error handling and user authentication
6. Support for multiple data formats from Oracle database
7. Comprehensive analytics and reporting
8. Indian currency (₹) and number formatting throughout

RECENT IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fixed dropdown data format compatibility issues
- Implemented location-based weather (different data for each city)
- Created admin notification system
- Enhanced authentication with database verification
- Fixed labor and fertilizer data filtering by farmer
- Implemented sequence management tools
- Added automatic session management

PROBLEM SOLVED:
Indian farmers often struggle with manual record-keeping, lack of real-time information, and difficulty in tracking farm operations. This system digitizes farm management, provides weather forecasts, tracks financial performance, and enables better decision-making through data analytics.
