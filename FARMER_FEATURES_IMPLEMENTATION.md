# Comprehensive Farmer Features Implementation

## Overview
Adding complete financial analytics, farm comparison, and CRUD operations for farmers.

## Backend Routes Completed âœ…

### 1. Financial Analytics (`/api/analytics/financial`)
**SQL Queries Used**:
```sql
-- Revenue
SELECT NVL(SUM(s.total_amount), 0) as total_revenue
FROM SALES s JOIN FARM f ON s.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Fertilizer Costs
SELECT NVL(SUM(fer.total_cost), 0) as fertilizer_cost
FROM FERTILIZER fer JOIN FARM f ON fer.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Labour Costs
SELECT NVL(SUM(lw.total_cost), 0) as labour_cost
FROM LABOURWORK lw JOIN FARM f ON lw.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Equipment Investment
SELECT NVL(SUM(e.purchase_cost), 0) as equipment_investment,
       NVL(SUM(e.current_value), 0) as equipment_current_value
FROM EQUIPMENT e WHERE e.farmer_id = :farmer_id
```

**Returns**: Revenue, Costs (fertilizer, labour), Investment (equipment), Profit, ROI

### 2. Farm Performance Comparison (`/api/analytics/farm-comparison`)
**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
  fm.farm_id, fm.farm_name, fm.area, fm.soil_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.crop_id) AS total_crops,
  SUM(c.expected_yield) AS expected_yield,
  SUM(c.actual_yield) AS actual_yield,
  ROUND((SUM(c.actual_yield) / NULLIF(SUM(c.expected_yield), 0)) * 100, 2) AS yield_efficiency,
  SUM(s.total_amount) AS revenue,
  SUM(fer.total_cost) AS fertilizer_cost,
  SUM(lw.total_cost) AS labour_cost,
  (SUM(s.total_amount) - (NVL(SUM(fer.total_cost), 0) + NVL(SUM(lw.total_cost), 0))) AS profit,
  ROUND(SUM(s.total_amount) / NULLIF(fm.area, 0), 2) AS revenue_per_acre
FROM FARM fm
LEFT JOIN CROP c ON fm.farm_id = c.farm_id
LEFT JOIN SALES s ON fm.farm_id = s.farm_id
LEFT JOIN FERTILIZER fer ON fm.farm_id = fer.farm_id
LEFT JOIN LABOURWORK lw ON fm.farm_id = lw.farm_id
WHERE fm.farmer_id = :farmer_id
GROUP BY fm.farm_id, fm.farm_name, fm.area, fm.soil_type
ORDER BY profit DESC
```

**Returns**: List of farms with performance metrics, sorted by profit

### 3. CRUD Operations Added

#### Delete Crop (`DELETE /api/crops/:crop_id`)
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT c.crop_id, c.crop_name, f.farmer_id
FROM CROP c JOIN FARM f ON c.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE c.crop_id = :crop_id AND f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Delete
DELETE FROM CROP WHERE crop_id = :crop_id
```

#### Delete Labour (`DELETE /api/labours/:labour_id`)
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT labour_id, name FROM LABOUR WHERE labour_id = :labour_id

-- Delete
DELETE FROM LABOUR WHERE labour_id = :labour_id
```

#### Update Payment Status (`PUT /api/sales/:sale_id/payment-status`)
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT s.sale_id, s.payment_status as old_status, s.buyer_name
FROM SALES s JOIN FARM f ON s.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE s.sale_id = :sale_id AND f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Update
UPDATE SALES 
SET payment_status = :payment_status
WHERE sale_id = :sale_id
```

#### Update Farm (`PUT /api/farms/:farm_id`)
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT farm_id FROM FARM 
WHERE farm_id = :farm_id AND farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Update
UPDATE FARM 
SET farm_name = :farm_name, location = :location,
    area = :area, soil_type = :soil_type, soil_ph = :soil_ph,
    irrigation_type = :irrigation_type, farm_type = :farm_type
WHERE farm_id = :farm_id
```

#### Get Farm by ID (`GET /api/farms/:farm_id`)
```sql
SELECT * FROM FARM 
WHERE farm_id = :farm_id AND farmer_id = :farmer_id
```

## Frontend Pages to Create

**Features**:
- Total Revenue card
- Total Costs breakdown (Fertilizer, Labour)
- Equipment Investment
- Net Profit
- Profit Margin %
- ROI %

### 2. Farm Comparison Page (`/farm-comparison`)
**Features**:
- Table comparing all farms
- Metrics: Yield Efficiency, Revenue, Profit, Revenue per Acre
- Highlight best performing farm
- Sort by different metrics
- SQL query visualization

### 3. Enhanced Crops Page
**Add**:
- Delete button for each crop
- Confirmation modal
- SQL DELETE query visualization

### 4. Enhanced Labours Page
**Add**:
- Delete button for each labour
- Confirmation modal
- SQL DELETE query visualization

### 5. Enhanced Sales Page

## DBMS Concepts Demonstrated

### Financial Analytics
- Aggregate functions (SUM, NVL)
- Multiple JOIN operations
- Calculated fields (profit, ROI)
- Grouping across tables

### Farm Comparison
- Complex SELECT with multiple JOINs
- NULLIF for safe division
- ROUND for formatting
- ORDER BY for ranking
- Aggregate functions

### CRUD Operations
- DELETE with CASCADE considerations
- UPDATE with validation
- SELECT for ownership verification
- COMMIT for transaction control

## Implementation Status

### Backend âœ… Complete
- [x] Financial analytics route
- [x] Farm comparison route
- [x] Delete crop endpoint
- [x] Delete labour endpoint
- [x] Update payment status endpoint
- [x] Update farm endpoint
- [x] Get farm by ID endpoint
- [x] Register routes in server.js

### Frontend ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Financial Analytics page
- [ ] Farm Comparison page
- [ ] Enhanced Crops with delete
- [ ] Enhanced Labours with delete
- [ ] Enhanced Sales with payment update
- [ ] Edit Farm page
- [ ] Update App.jsx routes
- [ ] Update Dashboard navigation

## SQL Visualization Pattern

All operations will show:
1. **Validation Query** - Check ownership/existence
2. **Main Query** - The actual operation (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
3. **Result** - What changed/was returned
4. **Execution Time** - Performance metrics

## Next Steps

1. Create Financial Analytics page with charts
2. Create Farm Comparison table
3. Add delete buttons to Crops/Labours pages
4. Add payment status update to Sales page
5. Create Edit Farm page
6. Update routes and navigation
7. Test all CRUD operations
8. Document SQL queries used

**Status**: Backend Complete, Frontend In Progress
**Target**: Full CRUD + Analytics for Farmers
