# 🔍 Farm Update Still Hanging - Debug Guide

## ✅ Progress So Far

From your logs, I can see:
```
✅ Farmer 3 verified and ACTIVE
🔍 Farm update request: {
  farm_id: 1,
  farmer_id: 3,
  farmer_id_type: 'number',  ← FIXED! Now a number
  farm_name: 'farm11'
}
✅ Connected to Oracle Database
```

**Good news:** The farmer_id is now correctly a number (not a string)!

**Problem:** The update query is still hanging - there's no completion or error message.

## 🎯 Possible Causes

### 1. **Database Lock** (Most Likely)
The FARM table might be locked by another session or uncommitted transaction.

### 2. **Trigger Issue**
The `TRG_FARM_UPDATE` trigger tries to update FARMER table, which might be causing issues.

### 3. **Connection Timeout**
Database connection might be timing out or hanging.

## ✅ Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Check for Locks in Database

```sql
-- Run in SQL*Plus to check for locks
SELECT 
  s.sid,
  s.serial#,
  s.username,
  s.status,
  s.lockwait,
  s.blocking_session,
  o.object_name,
  l.locked_mode
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$locked_object l ON s.sid = l.session_id
JOIN dba_objects o ON l.object_id = o.object_id
WHERE o.object_name IN ('FARM', 'FARMER');

-- If you see locks, kill the locking session:
-- ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION 'sid,serial#';
```

### Fix 2: Commit Any Pending Transactions

```sql
-- Connect to Oracle
sqlplus your_username/your_password

-- Check for uncommitted transactions
SELECT * FROM v$transaction;

-- Commit everything
COMMIT;
```

### Fix 3: Restart Database Connection Pool

```bash
# Stop backend
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm run dev

# Wait 5 seconds

# Restart backend
cd ISFS_backend
npm run dev
```

### Fix 4: Disable Trigger Temporarily

If the trigger is causing issues:

```sql
-- Disable the update trigger
ALTER TRIGGER TRG_FARM_UPDATE DISABLE;

-- Try update again

-- Re-enable trigger after testing
ALTER TRIGGER TRG_FARM_UPDATE ENABLE;
```

### Fix 5: Check if FARMER Record Exists

```sql
-- The trigger tries to update FARMER table
-- Make sure farmer 3 exists
SELECT * FROM FARMER WHERE farmer_id = 3;

-- If not found, the trigger fails silently!
```

## 🔧 Enhanced Backend Logging

I've added detailed logging to the farm update endpoint. You should now see:

```
🔍 Farm update request: { farm_id: 1, farmer_id: 3, ... }
🔍 Checking if farm 1 belongs to farmer 3...
📊 Farm check result: { found: true, rows: 1 }
✅ Farm verified, proceeding with update...
📝 Update data: { farm_name: '...', ... }
✅ Farm 1 updated successfully!  ← Should see this!
```

If you DON'T see "✅ Farm 1 updated successfully!", the query is hanging.

## 🚨 Emergency Fix: Bypass Trigger

Create a simple test update without trigger:

```sql
-- Manually update farm to test
UPDATE FARM 
SET farm_name = 'TEST_UPDATE'
WHERE farm_id = 1 
AND farmer_id = 3;

COMMIT;
```

If this works manually but not through the API, it's a connection/transaction issue.

If this ALSO hangs, it's a database lock issue.

## 🧪 Test Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend Logs

Try the update again and watch the backend console. You should see:

1. ✅ "Farm update request..."
2. ✅ "Checking if farm..."
3. ✅ "Farm check result..."
4. ✅ "Farm verified..."
5. ✅ "Update data..."
6. ❓ "Farm updated successfully" ← Missing? Query is hanging here!

### Step 2: Check Database

While the update is hanging, run:

```sql
-- Check active sessions
SELECT sid, serial#, username, status, sql_text
FROM v$session s
LEFT JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE username = 'YOUR_DB_USER'
AND status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### Step 3: Force Restart Everything

```bash
# 1. Stop backend (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Connect to Oracle and commit/rollback
sqlplus your_user/your_pass
COMMIT;
exit

# 3. Restart backend
npm run dev

# 4. In browser: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
# 5. Logout and login again
# 6. Try update
```

## 📊 What to Send Me

If still not working, send me:

1. **Full backend console output** from the moment you click Update
2. **Any SQL errors** from Oracle
3. **Result of this query:**
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, status, trigger_type
FROM user_triggers
WHERE table_name = 'FARM';
```

4. **Result of:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM FARMER WHERE farmer_id = 3;
SELECT * FROM FARM WHERE farm_id = 1;
```

## 💡 Most Likely Solution

Based on patterns, it's probably a **database lock** or **trigger issue**.

Try this NOW:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Stop backend (Ctrl+C)

# Terminal 2: Connect to Oracle
sqlplus your_user/your_pass
COMMIT;
ALTER TRIGGER TRG_FARM_UPDATE DISABLE;
exit

# Terminal 1: Restart backend
npm run dev

# Browser: Try update again - should work now!

# After it works, re-enable trigger:
ALTER TRIGGER TRG_FARM_UPDATE ENABLE;
```
