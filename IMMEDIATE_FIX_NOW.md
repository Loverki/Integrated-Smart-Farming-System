# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX - Farm Update Hanging

## ✅ The Problem

Your request reaches the backend (farmer_id is correctly a number), but the database UPDATE query hangs and never completes.

## 🎯 Most Likely Cause

The `TRG_FARM_UPDATE` trigger is trying to update the FARMER table, but **farmer 3 doesn't exist** or the FARMER table is locked.

## ⚡ QUICK FIX (Do This NOW)

### Option 1: Disable Trigger (Fast!)

```bash
# 1. Open SQL*Plus
sqlplus startfarm/startfarm@localhost:1521/xepdb1

# 2. Commit any pending changes
COMMIT;

# 3. Disable the problematic trigger
ALTER TRIGGER TRG_FARM_UPDATE DISABLE;

# 4. Exit
exit
```

Now try the farm update again - should work instantly!

### Option 2: Fix the Root Cause

```sql
-- Connect to Oracle
sqlplus startfarm/startfarm@localhost:1521/xepdb1

-- Check if farmer 3 exists
SELECT * FROM FARMER WHERE farmer_id = 3;

-- If NO ROWS, that's the problem! The trigger can't update a non-existent farmer
-- Solution: Register as farmer first, then add farms

-- If rows exist, check for locks:
SELECT * FROM v$locked_object;

-- If locks exist, commit:
COMMIT;

exit
```

### Option 3: Nuclear Option (If nothing else works)

```bash
# 1. Stop backend (Press Ctrl+C in backend terminal)

# 2. Connect to Oracle and reset everything
sqlplus startfarm/startfarm@localhost:1521/xepdb1
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
exit

# 3. Restart backend
cd C:\Coding\db_pr\Integrated-Smart-Farming-System\ISFS_backend
npm run dev

# 4. In browser:
#    - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
#    - Clear localStorage: F12 > Application > Local Storage > Clear All
#    - Logout and Login again
#    - Try update
```

## 📊 Diagnostic: What to Check

Run this in SQL*Plus RIGHT NOW while the update is hanging:

```sql
SELECT 
  s.sid,
  s.serial#,
  s.username,
  s.status,
  s.sql_text
FROM v$session s
LEFT JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id  
WHERE username = 'STARTFARM';
```

This shows what query is currently running and if it's stuck.

## 🎯 The Real Issue

Looking at your earlier work:
1. You deleted farmer 2
2. But you're logged in as farmer 3
3. When you update farm 1, the trigger tries to update farmer 3's totals
4. If farmer 3 doesn't exist or has issues, the trigger hangs

**Solution:** Make sure the farmer you're logged in as actually exists in the database!

## ✅ Verify Farmer Exists

```sql
-- This farmer MUST exist for updates to work
SELECT farmer_id, name, status, total_farms, total_area 
FROM FARMER 
WHERE farmer_id = 3;
```

If this returns 0 rows:
- **You're logged in as a deleted farmer!**
- Logout, register a new farmer, then login
- Or insert farmer 3 manually:

```sql
INSERT INTO FARMER (farmer_id, name, phone, password, status)
VALUES (3, 'Test Farmer', '1234567890', 'hash123', 'ACTIVE');
COMMIT;
```

## 🚀 After Fixing

Once you fix the issue, you'll see in backend console:

```
✅ Farm verified, proceeding with update...
📝 Update data: {...}
✅ Farm 1 updated successfully!  ← This should appear!
```

If you still don't see "✅ Farm 1 updated successfully!", the database query is definitely hanging.

## 💡 Quick Test

Try this simple SQL update manually:

```sql
UPDATE FARM 
SET farm_name = 'QUICK_TEST'
WHERE farm_id = 1;
```

- **If this hangs:** Database lock issue - run COMMIT;
- **If this works:** Backend/trigger issue - disable trigger
- **If this gives error:** Farmer doesn't exist - check FARMER table

**Try Option 1 (disable trigger) RIGHT NOW and let me know if it works!**
