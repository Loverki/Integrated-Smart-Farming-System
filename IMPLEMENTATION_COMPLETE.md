---

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### ✅ Backend Routes Created

#### 1. **Financial Analytics** (`analyticsRoutes.js`)
**Route**: `GET /api/analytics/financial`

**SQL Queries Executed**:
```sql
-- Revenue
SELECT NVL(SUM(s.total_amount), 0) as total_revenue
FROM SALES s JOIN FARM f ON s.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Fertilizer Costs
SELECT NVL(SUM(fer.total_cost), 0) as fertilizer_cost
FROM FERTILIZER fer JOIN FARM f ON fer.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Labour Costs
SELECT NVL(SUM(lw.total_cost), 0) as labour_cost
FROM LABOURWORK lw JOIN FARM f ON lw.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Equipment Investment
SELECT NVL(SUM(e.purchase_cost), 0) as equipment_investment,
       NVL(SUM(e.current_value), 0) as equipment_current_value
FROM EQUIPMENT e WHERE e.farmer_id = :farmer_id
```

**Returns**:
- Total Revenue
- Operating Costs (Fertilizer + Labour)
- Equipment Investment
- Net Profit
- Profit Margin %
- ROI %

#### 2. **Farm Performance Comparison** (`analyticsRoutes.js`)
**Route**: `GET /api/analytics/farm-comparison`

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
  fm.farm_id, fm.farm_name, fm.area, fm.soil_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.crop_id) AS total_crops,
  SUM(c.expected_yield) AS expected_yield,
  SUM(c.actual_yield) AS actual_yield,
  ROUND((SUM(c.actual_yield) / NULLIF(SUM(c.expected_yield), 0)) * 100, 2) AS yield_efficiency,
  SUM(s.total_amount) AS revenue,
  SUM(fer.total_cost) AS fertilizer_cost,
  SUM(lw.total_cost) AS labour_cost,
  (SUM(s.total_amount) - (NVL(SUM(fer.total_cost), 0) + NVL(SUM(lw.total_cost), 0))) AS profit,
  ROUND(SUM(s.total_amount) / NULLIF(fm.area, 0), 2) AS revenue_per_acre
FROM FARM fm
LEFT JOIN CROP c ON fm.farm_id = c.farm_id
LEFT JOIN SALES s ON fm.farm_id = s.farm_id
LEFT JOIN FERTILIZER fer ON fm.farm_id = fer.farm_id
LEFT JOIN LABOURWORK lw ON fm.farm_id = lw.farm_id
WHERE fm.farmer_id = :farmer_id
GROUP BY fm.farm_id, fm.farm_name, fm.area, fm.soil_type
ORDER BY profit DESC
```

**Returns**: Array of farms with complete performance metrics

#### 3. **CRUD Operations Added**

**Delete Crop** - `DELETE /api/crops/:crop_id`
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT c.crop_id, c.crop_name, f.farmer_id
FROM CROP c JOIN FARM f ON c.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE c.crop_id = :crop_id AND f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Delete (CASCADE handles related records)
DELETE FROM CROP WHERE crop_id = :crop_id
```

**Delete Labour** - `DELETE /api/labours/:labour_id`
```sql
SELECT labour_id, name FROM LABOUR WHERE labour_id = :labour_id
DELETE FROM LABOUR WHERE labour_id = :labour_id
```

**Update Payment Status** - `PUT /api/sales/:sale_id/payment-status`
```sql
-- Validation
SELECT s.sale_id, s.payment_status, s.buyer_name
FROM SALES s JOIN FARM f ON s.farm_id = f.farm_id
WHERE s.sale_id = :sale_id AND f.farmer_id = :farmer_id

-- Update
UPDATE SALES SET payment_status = :payment_status WHERE sale_id = :sale_id
```

**Update Farm** - `PUT /api/farms/:farm_id`
```sql
UPDATE FARM 
SET farm_name = :farm_name, location = :location, area = :area,
    soil_type = :soil_type, soil_ph = :soil_ph,
    irrigation_type = :irrigation_type, farm_type = :farm_type
WHERE farm_id = :farm_id
```

**Get Farm by ID** - `GET /api/farms/:farm_id`
```sql
